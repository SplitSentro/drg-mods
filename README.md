# SplitSentro's DRG Mods

## RestartMission
Provides many QoL features for game mode management. Currently WIP. Need feedback.

## TemperatureNumber
Displays current / burn / freeze / unfreeze/ douse fire temperature number on top of a regular enemy temperature icon.

## Elimination with Waves
Unlocks both normal and scripted waves after a Dreadnought spawn.

## ActorMonitor
Intended to provide additional info about game entities. As of now, you can press \~, aim at a bug, press Ctrl+\~ and then it will show Status Effects and amount of instances for each of them above the bug. Currently on hold. Very early stage.

To install, you'll need UE 4.27.2 and FSD-Template.
