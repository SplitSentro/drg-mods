# SplitSentro's DRG Mods

## RestartMission
Provides many QoL features for game mode management. Currently WIP. Need feedback.

## ActorMonitor
Intended to provide additional info about game entities. As of now, you can press \~, aim at a bug, press Ctrl+\~ and then it will show Status Effects and amount of instances for each of them above the bug. Currently on hold. Very early stage.

To install, you'll need UE 4.27.2 and FSD-Template.
