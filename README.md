# SplitSentro's DRG Mods

## RestartMission
Provides many QoL features for managing the game mode. Currently WIP. Need feedback.

## ActorMonitor
Intended to provide additional info about game entities. As of now, you can press \~, aim at a bug, press Ctrl+\~ and then it will show Status Effects and amount of instances for each of them above the bug. Currently on hold. Very early stage.
